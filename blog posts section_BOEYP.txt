BODABODA YOUTH EMPOWERMENT PROJECT (BOYEP)
1. BOYEP Kicks Off with Strong Stakeholder Support in Ilala and Kinondoni
Date:

The Boda Boda Youth Empowerment Project (BOYEP) officially launched with a high-energy two-day inception workshop. Organized by PFP and funded by VOICE Tanzania, the workshop marked a crucial starting point for the project, bringing together key stakeholders from Ilala and Kinondoni Municipalities.
The main goal of this workshop was to introduce the BOYEP initiative, its objectives, and the role it intends to play in promoting youth leadership, traffic discipline, and civic engagement among motorcycle taxi riders. Participants included representatives from municipal governments, traffic police, youth groups, and local civil society organizations.
Discussions at the workshop covered:
* The importance of youth inclusion in local governance and decision-making.
* Strategies for reducing road accidents and unsafe riding practices.
* The need to rebrand the image of Bodaboda riders through structured capacity-building.
Stakeholders expressed strong support for the initiative, especially given the challenges posed by the Bodaboda sector, which is often linked to rising road accidents and urban insecurity. The workshop concluded with a joint commitment from local leaders and PFP to work hand-in-hand in ensuring the project reaches its full potential.
2. Road Safety & Leadership Training Underway for Boda Boda Youth
Date:

Training has officially begun for Bodaboda youth under the BOYEP project — and it’s already making a difference. So far, four dedicated training groups have been formed, each made up of a total of 50 riders selected from Ilala and Kinondoni districts.
These training sessions focus on:
* Leadership and confidence building
* Understanding road safety and traffic laws
* Civic rights and responsibilities
Held in accessible community centers, the training modules are designed to be participatory, combining discussions, real-life scenarios, and role-playing exercises. The goal is to equip riders not just to follow the law but to become advocates for safer roads and better governance in their communities.
The need for this training is urgent. According to Tanzania’s National Traffic Report (2013), Bodaboda were involved in over 8,241 road incidents, resulting in 1,058 deaths and injuries to over 6,500 people. These numbers are alarming, especially since many of the riders are young men trying to earn a living under risky conditions.
With this training, BOYEP is taking a bold step toward changing the culture on the roads—empowering riders to value safety, follow regulations, and speak up for their rights.
3. Changing the Narrative – Boda Boda Youth Step into Civic Participation
Date

For years, Bodaboda riders have been stigmatized as unsafe, unruly, and sometimes even dangerous. In fact, the government had to ban motorcycle taxis from entering city centers to curb rising incidents of theft and violence involving rogue riders.
But the BOYEP project is rewriting that story.
By training 1,000 young men aged 18–25 in leadership, traffic law awareness, and civic participation, the project is nurturing a new generation of riders who are responsible, engaged, and aware of their role in society.
These youth are now learning about:
* How to engage with local government structures
* Their rights and responsibilities as citizens
* How to form and lead associations that can advocate for better working conditions
BOYEP doesn’t just aim to reduce accidents or change behaviors — it’s about structural transformation. When youth are confident, knowledgeable, and organized, they become part of the solution. Riders who once feared or distrusted the system are now preparing to sit at the table where decisions are made.
This is more than a training program — it’s a civic awakening on two wheels.
