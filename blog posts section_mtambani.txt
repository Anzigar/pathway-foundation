4. Transforming Hygiene: 

Title: Hand Washing Facilities Boost Health at Mtambani and Kiharaka Schools
Date: 4.01.2020
Content:
The Pathways Foundation for the Poor (PFP), supported by IDAY International through the Elisabeth and Emile Foundation, has made remarkable strides in improving hygiene practices in Mtambani and Kiharaka primary schools. A key highlight of the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) project was the installation of hand washing facilities that have significantly enhanced the students’ learning environment.
Hand washing is a simple yet powerful defense against germs and waterborne diseases. Thanks to the newly installed hand wash stations, students have embraced the practice of washing their hands with running water and soap, effectively reducing the spread of respiratory and diarrheal infections within the schools. Teachers have played a critical role by dedicating extra time to teach proper hand washing techniques, such as gently lathering hands with soap and rinsing thoroughly under running water.
According to records from Mapinga Dispensary, there has been a notable 27% reduction in diarrhea cases among school children. This improvement is directly linked to better hygiene practices supported by the WASH project. The enhanced health environment has also contributed to improved school attendance, underscoring the importance of accessible hand washing facilities in boosting both health and education outcomes.
5. Improving School Infrastructure

Content:
A critical component of the WASH project is upgrading school sanitation infrastructure in Mtambani and Kiharaka. While significant progress was made, some challenges remain—particularly in fully equipping toilets with running water systems.
At Kiharaka Primary School, the school committee successfully installed water supply to the teachers’ toilets. This facility now includes four drop holes serving the 38 teachers, substantially improving hygiene and comfort for the school staff. The committee has expressed deep appreciation for the efforts made by IDAY International in constructing the students’ toilet structures, which currently await water installation to enable immediate use.
The plan is for the student toilets to be fully operational by January 2021, once the water system is in place. This step will ensure that students can benefit from safe and hygienic sanitation facilities, an essential factor for improving overall school health and creating an environment conducive to learning.




6. Government Partnership Enhances Sanitation

Title: 10 New Drop Holes Added at Kiharaka School
Date: 27.09.2019
Content:
The WASH project’s success is due in large part to strong community advocacy and government collaboration. In 2020, following training on participatory planning, the Kiharaka school committee engaged the local government to increase investment in school sanitation.
As a result, the local government constructed 10 additional drop holes at Kiharaka Primary School, complementing the facilities built by IDAY International. This expansion increased the total student drop holes from 4 to 19, a significant improvement addressing the needs of both male and female students.
The current setup includes:
* 5 student drop holes constructed by IDAY International
* 10 student drop holes funded by the local government
* 4 pre-existing student drop holes at the school
Additionally, for teachers, there are now four drop holes—two constructed by the government and two by IDAY International—ensuring adequate sanitation for all staff members.
This multi-stakeholder effort illustrates the power of community participation combined with government support to create sustainable school infrastructure improvements.
